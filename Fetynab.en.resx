        <value>In the context of competency-based higher education and the associated shift in perspective from "teaching to learning", learning objectives have also come into focus. Learning objectives are also the most precise description of the desired learning outcomes. Learning outcomes describe what students should know and be able to do at the end of a learning section and what attitudes are expected of them. They are recorded in writing and communicated in a situational manner. The what-whereby-what-for-structure and taxonomy of learning objectives (e.g. according to Anderson &amp; Krathwohl) are helpful in this context, to select appropriate verbs for formulating learning outcomes on the basis of different levels of competence.</value>
